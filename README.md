### Hello, nerds

* I'm currently working on Rust. After all my hardships on the steep road to know all these stuffs, no surprisingly, I think Rust is the best system-programming language I have ever seen 😄.
* I'm looking for someone to translate the book _Programming Rust_ into Chinese with me. [Details](https://github.com/TENX-S/Programming-Rust-Translation/blob/master/README.md)
