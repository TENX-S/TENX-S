* I'm currently working on building an music app which not just played music(surely) but do have some great power like decrypt downloaded file from some music platform we familiar (Netease, QQ, Xiami, etc) to original format like flac, mp3, etc,  several languages like C/C++, Swift, Rust, Python and  bash all work together to implement these abilities.

* I'm currently also learning on Rust and get as deep as I can. After all my hardships on learning process, no surprisingly, I think Rust is the best system-programming language I ever been seen ðŸ˜„.
* Any questions about my pinned repositories is welcome. Just Email me:)
